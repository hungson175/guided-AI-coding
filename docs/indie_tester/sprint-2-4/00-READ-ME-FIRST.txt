                      WHAT THE TEST VALIDATED
================================================================================

The Chat -> Terminal Command feature:
  ✓ Users can type terminal commands in chat (with $ prefix)
  ✓ Send button works and submits the command
  ✓ System detects $ prefix and routes to terminal
  ✓ Terminal executes the command (tested with "pwd")
  ✓ Output displays in the chat interface
  ✓ All services (frontend, backend, terminal) work together
  ✓ Performance is acceptable

                         KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

Previous Test Attempt (FAILED):
